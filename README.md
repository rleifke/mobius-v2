## Notes

1. Foundry piggybacks off [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage dependencies. There's a [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html) about how to work with dependencies in the book.
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful when debugging and testing against a mainnet fork.
